As of 11/27:

Things to note:

-Data has been parsed using the Python script as promised, there are 2
"polished" files "ROUTES_clean.txt" and "IATA_clean.txt". We take these
and use them in our world (graph class) constructor, where we have 2 maps.
-The first map assigns any airport name to its unique identifier # from
OpenFlights (ie. ORD and KORD both map to 3830), and the second map
assigns the unique identifier # to a vector of unique identifier #'s
representing where a flight's directed route leads to.
-The vector of identifier #'s has also been dealt with to remove any
duplicate entries for freeing memory and also to avoid confusion during
any traversal (just in case).
