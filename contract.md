# Team Contract


### Communication

1. Team Meetings: Weekly on Saturdays from 8-9p.m., either via Zoom or Discord: https://discord.gg/UP7JWcMQdD. 
Meetings will last roughly 1 hour, usually as catch up for information and progress, but can be extended as necessary.

2. Assistance: Contact will be done through Discord and a text message group chat. 
Most members are very responsive through these messengers, so there should not be too much delay in expecting a response from teammates. 

3. Respect: Allow everyone to input ideas and encourage collaboration. 
For example, on Discord we have a channel dedicated to requests and input ideas which allows us to at least get ideas down for everyone to see. 
If the idea has potential issues or is not comprehensive enough, then groupmates will respectfully and constructively discuss possible improvements to the idea or suggest a potential alternative.


### Collaboration

1. Work Distribution: Each person will contribute roughly Â¼ of the total project for a total of 1 whole project. 
Specific work aspects of the project will be discussed and assigned as specific aspects of the project are determined.

2. Time Commitment: As a group, about 40 hours of work should be done each week. 
This should be distributed amongst the 4 group members, giving each member an expected working time of 10 hours per week. 
If group members are unable to work, they will inform the rest of the group.

3. Conflict Resolution: Conflict resolution will be done democratically as all members will get an input when conflict occurs. 
If the conflict can not be talked through within the group then we will contact our TA, Sahil Agrawal.
